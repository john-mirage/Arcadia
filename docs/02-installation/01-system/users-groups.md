This page describes how to add a password on the root user and how to create an unprivileged user with temporary root privileges.

## Add a root password

``` bash
passwd
```

:::caution

Passwords must be complex enough to not be easily guessed from e.g. personal information, or cracked using methods like social engineering or brute-force attacks. The tenets of strong passwords are based on length and randomness.
