# Encryption
This page describes how to setup the system partition encryption of the NVMe storage device. Encryption is made with the cryptsetup program and LUKS2.

## Create the LUKS2 container

``` bash
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

:::caution

Passwords must be complex enough to not be easily guessed from e.g. personal information, or cracked using methods like social engineering or brute-force attacks. The tenets of strong passwords are based on length and randomness.

## Open the LUKS2 container

``` bash
cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptroot
```
