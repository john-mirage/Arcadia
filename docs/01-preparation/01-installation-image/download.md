# Download
This page describes how to download the official ISO image, the checksum and the signature of the Arch Linux latest release.

## Download the ISO image
Downloading the Arch Linux ISO image can be done from any mirror, but it might be better to select a mirror close to your geographic location. The proximity of a mirror maximizes your chances of downloading the ISO image with the best download speed.

1. Open your browser and go to the [Arch Linux pacman mirrorlist generator](https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/).
1. Filter the mirrors according to the closest **country** to yours and the **HTTPS** protocol.
1. Generate the list

Now that you have a list of mirrors that match your criteria, you can go to one of those mirrors and download the Arch Linux ISO image.

1. Open your browser and go to the [Arch Linux download page](https://www.archlinux.org/download/)
1. Click on one of the **HTTPS** mirror sites of your generated list.
1. Download the Arch Linux ISO image `archlinux-year.day.month-x86_64.iso`

## Download the ISO image checksum
In the next section (verification), The checksum will allow us to verify if the downloaded file is the same as the one provided by the Arch Linux team.

1. Open your browser and go to the [Arch Linux download page](https://www.archlinux.org/download/).
1. Under the HTTP Direct Downloads section, copy the **SHA-1** or **BLAKE2b** checksum in your clipboard.

You can now create the checksum file with the following command. 

``` bash
echo "<CHECKSUM> archlinux-year.month.day-x86_64.iso" \
     > archlinux-year.month.day-x86_64.iso.txt
```

:::caution

Replace `<CHECKSUM>` with the SHA-1 or BLAKE2b checksum previously copied from the Arch Linux download page.
